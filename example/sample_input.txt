This is some sample input for the GeoExtract example.

The easiest locations are those that are referred to by their name, for example
the Konzerthaus or the Rathaus.

Also common are addresses. These may be fully specified, e.g. Karlstr. 7, 76133
Karlsruhe (note that this one spans multiple lines) or they may only consist of
a street and a house number, such as Kaiserstrasse 3. Finally, people may simply
be talking about a certain street, e.g. the Rüppurrer Straße. And then there
are some more complex variants, for example house number ranges like Festplatz
3-19 and funky house number such as Festplatz 11c. As you have seen we also
have to account for a lot of spelling variants and abbreviations for "Straße".

However, not everything that looks like an address also is one. Often, street
names are followed by numbers that are not really house numbers, for example
when listing how much it will cost to repair those streets:

    STREET                COSTS
    Festplatz              1000
    Karl-Friedrich-Straße   943

One also has to take the layout of the text into consideration. Typically,
software processes text in a line-by-line fashion, but that doesn't always
correspond to the true layout of the text. For example, here is a small
table where a pure line-by-line technique won't work:

    Person A                        Person B
    Rüppurrer Straße 12             Kaiserstraße 8
    76137 Karlsruhe                 76133 Karlsruhe
